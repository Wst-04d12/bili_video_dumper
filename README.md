The tested runtime is unmodified Lua 5.4.x, and in the CMD and Windows Console Host as it runs, if you are using the other console like powershell, you might haveing some issue on ensuring the file path you entered to the command line interface are not contains "&" or that things, the default quote added by the CMD is acceptable, if you are still getting sone issue on the path, just delete any "" and & of the path, even if there is spaces in the path. Like this  
C:\test folder\my videos\video 1.mp4  
and press enter.  
The output will generated at the same directory where this program was being executed, and named `out.mp4`.  
No worry if you were putting the wrong things into this program, because it reads the input as `READ ONLY`, and if it has the wrong binary headers, the program will not continue but exit and give you the tip.
